Exiled to the past for crimes done in the future, Euler is a powerful wizard (or perhaps a technomancer?) who has been banished by a powerful, secret, timeline manipulating society due to his actions at some point in the future. Unfortunately, what Euler has actually done, he cannot remember, for the process used to banish him to the future has caused some sort of amnesia, supressing some of his memories. All Euler knows is that he does not belong in this era, and that he has been banished. Who has banished him, the details of his crime, and whether it was even a crime, as well as most of his power and skills, have been forgotten (for now at least...)

Euler comes across as shrewd and calculative, often acting for his own purposes and interests. He is not afraid to torture or kill to get his way. He continues to roam the Forgotten Realms to earn a living and to survive, until he can figure out the details of his exile, and find a way back to his own time.

## The Era of Origin (DM Eyes only)

Euler comes from a century far beyond the typical Forgotten Realms timeline — a sleek, mage-engineered age where:

- Arcanotech replaces most mundane technologies
- Temporal studies are a secretive but established magical discipline
- Societies are governed by councils of Chronomancers, Arcanists, and technomancers    
- Time travel is _possible_, but highly restricted

This era is known as **The Luminous Age** or **The Crystal Horizon**, depending on which faction told the story.

## The Cabal That Banished Him

Known simply as **The Equilibrium**, this clandestine order polices temporal anomalies and interferes with timelines to prevent disasters, paradoxes, or tyrants.

To the public, they do not exist.  
To Euler, they are the only thing he remembers with clarity — as if their sigil is _burned_ into his mind.

## The Exile Ritual

The temporal banishment ripped fragments of:

- His memories
- His spell knowledge
- His emotional connections
- His sense of self

He was dropped into the Forgotten Realms centuries before his birth. His powers now manifest irregularly, like a corrupted spellbook rebooting.
