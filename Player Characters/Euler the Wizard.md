Exiled to the past for crimes done in the future, Euler is a powerful wizard (or perhaps a technomancer?) who has been banished by a powerful, secret, timeline manipulating society due to his actions at some point in the future. Unfortunately, what Euler has actually done, he cannot remember, for the process used to banish him to the future has caused some sort of amnesia, supressing some of his memories. All Euler knows is that he does not belong in this era, and that he has been banished. Who has banished him, the details of his crime, and whether it was even a crime, as well as most of his power and skills, have been forgotten (for now at least...)

Euler comes across as shrewd and calculative, often acting for his own purposes and interests. He is not afraid to torture or kill to get his way. He continues to roam the Forgotten Realms to earn a living and to survive, until he can figure out the details of his exile, and find a way back to his own time.
