Orphaned at a young age and beset with rage and sorrow from this childhood trauma, Puumba was raised by wolves and his distant uncle Pythagoras the 7th. Having trained in martial arts, he roams the world of the Forgotten Realms trying to find the culprits who murdered his parents, in order to avenge them and seek justice

Puumba tends to be aggressive and impulsive, always ready for a fight and has an intimidating stature. Having lived a life of survival in the wilderness, he is also one who improvises and leaves no resources wasted, often looting defeated enemies for weapons and food. He often mutilates the bodies of his defeated enemies to take body parts as trophies for himself, or for practical use later.
