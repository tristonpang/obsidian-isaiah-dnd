Pumbaa was born into House Azarel, a Calishite noble family renowned for its discipline, martial tradition, and whispered connection to ancient fire teachings. The family estate stood in the heart of Calimport, where he spent his youth training with steel in the courtyards, studying under private tutors, and learning the breath techniques said to calm the flame within Azarel blood. His father taught him swordsmanship. His mother taught him focus. His siblings — Simbaa, Naela, and the youngest sister — taught him what a family should feel like.

Everything changed the night House Vaelith attacked. Fire Knives assassins tore through the estate, and Shadow Thieves plundered whatever they could carry. His parents and youngest sister were killed. Simbaa escaped into the night. Pumbaa survived only because his godfather, [[Pythagoras the 7th]], smuggled him out before the flames consumed the estate entirely.

[[Pythagoras the 7th|Pythagoras]] delivered him into the hands of the [[Order of Nameless Knights]], a hidden brotherhood sworn to protect sorcerers and the innocent. For years Pumbaa trained in anonymity — mastering the sword, strengthening his discipline, learning to control his emotions, and burying the fire within so no one would discover his bloodline. [[Order of Nameless Knights|The Order]] taught him to move unseen, to defend the helpless, and to survive even when hollowed by loss.

Yet as he grew older, the flame in his chest never disappeared. It simmered beneath his skin, waiting. When he finally stepped into the world on his own, he chose the path of the fighter — the only life he had ever known. His fire remained a secret, something to be feared or misunderstood, so he hid it behind breath techniques and martial stances.

Adventuring wasn’t a choice at first — it was survival. But along the way, Pumbaa found companions who became the family he thought he had lost. With them, he travels now not only to stay ahead of his enemies, but to reclaim his family’s honor, recover what was stolen, and one day face the truth of the fire that still burns inside him.

## Related Organisations:

#### [[Order of the Nameless Knights]]

A secretive brotherhood dedicated to training and protecting the scattered heirs of fallen noble houses. 

After the fall of House Azarel, I was taken in by this Order. They taught me anonymity, discipline, blade mastery, and the art of disappearing in plain sight. Their training blends soldier drills with espionage, teaching initiates to fight, endure, and survive without ever revealing their bloodline. Each member swears to shield the vulnerable, defend the forgotten, and one day help restore the balance stolen by the corrupt and powerful.

Though I left to walk my own path, the Order watches from afar. And if ever I call for aid, a Nameless Knight will answer.

#### [[Brotherhood of the True Flame]] (ancestral connection)

My family—House Azarel—had ancestral ties to this Brotherhood. Though rarely spoken of openly, their scrolls and rituals were kept in hidden chambers beneath our estate. Some say members of the Brotherhood carry draconic blood; others whisper that their founders were taught directly by fire dragons in the distant past. Their teachings include controlled breathwork, fluid martial movement, and meditative flame-guiding techniques—echoes of which shaped my own firebending style.

Though I was never formally initiated, fragments of their rituals, runes, and philosophies survived in my training. To enemies, the Brotherhood is a dangerous, mystical cult. To House Azarel, they were the keepers of ancient truth. To me… they are a reminder of a legacy that refuses to die.
