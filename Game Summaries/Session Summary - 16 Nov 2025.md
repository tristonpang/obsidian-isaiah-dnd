The party descended into the depths of Tresendar Manor, entering the dusty common room where four Redbrand ruffians lounged at their posts. Tension rose quickly, but through quick thinking and a surprising display of charm, the group managed to talk their way out of a fight. Wizard Zapto played a key role—cooling the ruffians’ drinks with a casual flourish and claiming his father had taught him such magic. The ruffians bought the story, allowing the party to pass without bloodshed.

Pressing further into the hideout, the adventurers’ presence did not go unnoticed. Iarno Albrek—better known as Glasstaff—became aware of the intrusion as they approached his workshop. When the party reached his quarters, the treacherous wizard had already fled. Fortunately, keen eyes uncovered the hidden escape route he used, and the chase began.

The pursuit culminated near the underground chasm. Donkeykonqueror surged ahead, catching Iarno and successfully grappling him as the wizard scrambled to protect himself with _Mage Armor_. Amid the struggle, a chaotic misstep by Theodore the paladin sent Pumbaa tumbling into the chasm—an accident that would not soon be forgotten. Despite the mishap, the party regained control of the situation.

Outnumbered and outmatched, Iarno surrendered and was handed over to Sildar Hallwinter. Under pressure, he divulged key information about the enigmatic Black Spider: a drow (dark elf) who had enlisted Iarno’s help to extort and intimidate the people of Phandalin. With this revelation, the party also secured the location of Cragmaw Castle. Droop the goblin agreed—timidly—to guide them there.

With the immediate threat defeated, Pumbaa returned to the now-abandoned Tresendar Manor while the rest of the party was resting at the Stonehill inn. Pumbaa seized the opportunity to claim the manor for himself and attempted to rally the remaining Redbrand ruffians under his command. However, the ruffians—demoralized and leaderless—chose instead to disband rather than follow a new master.

Before leaving, Pumbaa and Donkeykonqueror (who snuck in following Pumbaa) found themselves in a spirited wrestling match over Iarno’s leftover loot. After a rowdy struggle worthy of tavern legend, Donkeykonqueror emerged victorious, claiming the spoils while Pumbaa vowed to train harder for the next bout.

With tensions settled, the party prepared to embark on their next great pursuit: the journey to Cragmaw Castle and the secrets that await within.
